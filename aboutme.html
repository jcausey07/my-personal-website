      <p>Hi, my name is Jasmine Causey and I work as a Process Assistant
        for Amazon AMZL logistics warehouse. </p>
      <p>I have a background in Visual  merchandising, customer service and management.</p> 
      <p>One of my biggest achievements so far with Amazon was being able to head the problem 
         solve department.</p>
      <p>I was able to train associates and help strategize 
         and develop news way of working on issues and making that process</p>
      <p>more streamline to be able to get more packages out of problem state and into 
         the hands of the customer.</p>
      <p>Iâ€™m currently looking to change career paths and I enrolled in a program 
        with Amazon to move into software/ web development.</p>
      <p>My goals is to learn a coding language I like and potentially become a front end 
        developer for company.
