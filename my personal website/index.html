          <p>Hi, my name is Jasmine Causey and I work as a Process Assistant for Amazon AMZL logistics warehouse. I have a background in Visual merchandising, customer service and management. One of my biggest achievements so far with Amazon was being able to head the problem solve department. I was able to train associates and help strategize and develop news way of working on issues and making that process a faster to be able to get more packages out of problem state and into the hands of the customer.</p>
					<p>Iâ€™m currently looking to change career paths and I enrolled in a program with Amazon to move into a software/ web development career. My goals is to learn a coding language I like and potentially become a front end developer for Amazon.
</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center">My Journey to Web Devlopmentment</h3>
<p>*Learning to code seems challengeing but its really cool to have an amazing outcome of a website.</p>
<p>*I've learned mostly HTML so far but have tons more to learn.</p>
<p>*Such as CSS, Javascript, Animation and much more!!</p>
<p>*With classes being fully remote makes it interesting because you really have to push yourself to stay focus and keep up.</p>
